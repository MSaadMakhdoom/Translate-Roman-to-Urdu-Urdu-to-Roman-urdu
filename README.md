# Transliteration Script Python -Roman urdu to Urdu & Urdu to Roman urdu
Roman Urdu is the name used for the Urdu language written with the Latin script, also known as the Roman
script. The Urdu language is written in a different style as compared to English, making typing a challenging
task, and hence the popularity of Roman Urdu.

the goal is to implement and practice some basic text manipulation techniques for the
Urdu language. The system of Romanisation used most often by native speakers differs from the formal
systems presented in most English language sources. It contains no diacritics or special characters, usually
just the 26 letters of the core English alphabet.
your task is to perform transliteration from Roman Urdu to Urdu (roman2urdu) and
Urdu to Roman Urdu (urdu2roman). This assignment is designed to be completed from scratch. You
are free to use basic libraries if you are comfortable doing so and you can improve existing libraries like
urduhack (https : //urduhack.com/), but the functions available in these libraries do not use perform up
to the mark. You cannot use online API’s such as GoogleTranslate and iJunoon so that your program can
also execute offline.
There are several problems with existing Roman Urdu schemes. Either they are not reversible to Urdu script
or they don’t allow pronouncing the Urdu words properly. Another shortcoming is that a lot of Roman Urdu
schemes confuse the Urdu letter Choti He which has the sound of voiceless glottal fricative with Do Chasham
He which is used as a digraph for aspirated consonants in Urdu script. The digraphs Sh for letter Shin and
Zh for letter Zhe also cause problems as they could be interpreted as the letter Sin and Choti He or letter
Ze and Choti He respectively. Most Roman Urdu schemes also do not take much consideration of Urdu
orthography and the spelling system.


Challenges in transliteration involve determining longer textual processing units consisting of more than
one character. This task involves identifying grapheme boundaries within different words.
